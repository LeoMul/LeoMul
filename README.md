I'm a PhD student at the Astrophysics Research Centre at the Queen's University of Belfast.

My research focusses on the production and maintenance of Atomic Data, with a specific application to Kilonovae for my dissertation.

On this page you'll find utility codes for Atomic Data processing, modelling and generation. Where applicable, the production codes these correspond to are named in the respository description.

You'll also find respositories that contain passion projects, and codes from earier stages in my career, such as my internship at the University of Oldenburg and my Master's Project at Queen's.
